► Handling the image upload
▬  $Image=$_FILES['image'];
- This line retrieves the entire array of information related to the uploaded file.

▬ $image_location=$_FILES['image']['tmp_name'];
- الصورة والإمتداد الخاص بيها 
- This line extracts the temporary location on the server where the uploaded file is stored.
- After a file is uploaded, PHP temporarily stores it in a directory on the server. The exact location is given by $_FILES['image']['tmp_name'].
- This temporary file will be deleted automatically after the script ends, so it needs to be moved to a permanent location if you want to keep it.

▬ $image_name=$_FILES['image']['name'];
- الصورة واسمها
- This line retrieves the original name of the uploaded file.

▬ $image_up= "images/".$image_name;
- This line constructs the path where the uploaded image will be stored.
- "images/" is a directory in your project where you intend to save the uploaded images.
- By concatenating "images/" with $image_name, you create a full path like "images/example.jpg", where example.jpg is the name of the uploaded file.
- This path ($image_up) is the location where the file will be moved to using the move_uploaded_file() function.

▬ if (move_uploaded_file($image_location, $image_up)) {
    // Success: The file has been moved from its temporary location to the target directory.
    echo "<script>alert('تم رفع المنتج بنجاح')</script>";
} else {
    // Failure: The file could not be moved, possibly due to permission issues.
    echo "<script>alert('لم يتم رفع المنتج, لقد حدث خطأ ما!')</script>";
}
- move_uploaded_file($image_location, $image_up);: This function moves the file from the temporary location to the final destination ($image_up).
- Purpose of $image_up in SQL: The path to the uploaded image is saved in the database, so you can later display the image on your website.
